John's Project Notes

Animation data
https://amass.is.tue.mpg.de/
 - Read documentation
 - We're using the B...rub? One? Something like that.

Generated Meshes
https://smpl.is.tue.mpg.de/
 - Read documentation
 - They have blender models as well that I should check out! Maybe someone has a youtube video about getting animations in blender which could help me crack how to interpret data

	prepare_data.py		// The functions I'll need to process data from AMASS or SMPL
		- def get_joint_positions():
			- Gets some sort of mix of the transform and rotation data?? Output however I want, probably matrix?
			- At the end of the loop make it so you're actually saving the data
	lbs.py 			// Dependency that I probably don't need to directly use.
